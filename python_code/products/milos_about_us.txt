Our Story

Established in 2015 as a family-run café, Milos Coffee was born out of a passion for sharing high-quality, ethically-sourced coffee with the community. Milos love for both coffee and travel took her across South America, where she formed lasting partnerships with small farms and cooperatives. Every cup we serve tells a story—from the hands that cultivated the beans to the careful in-house roasting that brings out each origin’s distinct flavors.
